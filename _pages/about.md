As a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Utah, I am deeply passionate about technology and its transformative potential. My research focuses on advancing cutting-edge domains such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. 

I am committed to exploring innovative solutions that can address complex real-world problems. With a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science, I strive to contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape. 

My journey is driven by a curiosity to understand and harness technology's power to make a meaningful impact on society.
