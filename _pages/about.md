I am a first-year PhD student in the **Department of Biomedical Informatics** at the **University of Utah**, advised by Dr. [Kathy Sward](https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/katherine-sward), Dr. [Ramkiran Gouripeddi](https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/ramkiran-gouripeddi) and Dr. [Mollie Cummins](https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mollie-r-cummins). 

I hold a Master’s degree in **Biomedical Informatics (Data Science Track)** from the same university and a combined **B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Bioinformatics and Biotechnology** from Savitribai Phule Pune University, India. 

I am also a part of the [**SMARTER project**](https://www.smarterexposurehealth.org/overview), contributing to research focused on improving healthcare systems and outcomes.

### Academic and Professional Journey

During my academic career, I have developed skills in data analysis, machine learning, and computational modeling, working on projects that span multiple domains!
My academic journey reflects a strong commitment to interdisciplinary research, combining my love for biology, technology, and data science.

- **M.Sc. Thesis**: Binding affinity prediction of protein-protein complexes using machine learning, integrating Python, R, and graph-based methods.
- **Research Assistant**: Played a pivotal role in the **PCORnet RECOVER EHR Project**, coordinating with diverse teams to analyze telemedicine data and implement visualization frameworks.
- **Software Engineer**: Leveraged programming expertise to develop solutions in the automation industry before transitioning into research and data science.

### Publications and Conferences

I have contributed to peer-reviewed publications, including the [**Journal of Medical Internet Research**](https://sukrut-shishupal.github.io/publications/), and presented at [conferences](https://sukrut-shishupal.github.io/talks/) such as **DELPHI Symposium**. My research on telemedicine and emissions savings has been recognized for its innovative use of data science to address healthcare challenges.

### Beyond Academia

In addition to my academic and research pursuits, I am deeply engaged in community-building and leadership activities. I served as a **student representative for two years** in the Department of Biomedical Informatics, where I advocated for graduate student interests and helped foster a collaborative environment. 

As the [**treasurer for the Indian Students Association**](https://indianstudentsatutah.org/team.html), I managed finances and led strategic initiatives to support cultural events and student welfare.

My passion for outreach includes volunteering with educational and environmental initiatives, from teaching microbiology techniques to middle school students to organizing trekking activities. Notably, I received the **Best Instructor Award** for mentoring students during a week-long biological science workshop.

Furthermore, I captained my department’s football and volleyball teams for five years, leading them to wins, showcasing my dedication to teamwork and perseverance both on and off the field.

### Skills and Interests

I am proficient in **Python, R, SQL, JAVA**. My technical expertise is complemented by a love for **sports**, having captained my department’s football and volleyball teams for five years, and a passion for trekking and exploring the outdoors.
