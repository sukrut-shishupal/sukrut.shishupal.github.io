RECOVER, a large-scale NIH initiative, aims to understand, prevent, and treat Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Leveraging data science techniques and a national EHR repository, the project focuses on identifying PASC subtypes, risk factors, disparities, and healthcare utilization. Year 1 accomplishments include phenotype development, risk factor analysis, and disparity assessments, paving the way for clinical trials and targeted interventions in Year 2.

- Developed a unified repository of PASC data from 40 sites nationwide.
- Used AI and machine learning to create computable phenotypes and predictive models.
- Addressed disparities in PASC incidence and healthcare utilization across demographics.
